#Terminal Chess

This is a program to run a two player game of chess in the terminal. So far in order to move you type in the grid location of the piece you would like to move (ex 1 1) followed by where to move it to (1 5). Checks are in place to ensure you only make a valid move. You can escape out of the game at any time by typing quit.

###Still to be implemented

Currently there is no method in the program to determine if either player has been checkmated.
